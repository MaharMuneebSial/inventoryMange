HOW TO FIX THE "NOT NULL constraint failed: products.category_id" ERROR
================================================================================

The code has been updated to make Category, Sub-Category, and Brand optional.
However, your current database still has the old schema with NOT NULL constraints.

SOLUTION: Reset the database to create a new one with the updated schema.

STEPS TO FIX:
-------------

1. Close the application completely (close all windows)

2. Double-click on "reset-database.bat" in this folder

3. Wait for the app to restart automatically

4. Done! Now you can add products with only Product Name (all other fields are optional)


WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES:
--------------------
- Stops all Node.js and Electron processes
- Deletes the old database file (located at %APPDATA%\my-app\inventory.db)
- Creates a new database with the updated schema
- Starts the application


NOTE:
-----
⚠️ This will DELETE ALL your existing data in the database!
⚠️ Make sure you have a backup if you need to keep your data.

If you want to keep your data, you'll need to export it first before running the reset.


ALTERNATIVE (Manual Method):
----------------------------
If the batch file doesn't work, you can manually:

1. Close the application
2. Press Windows + R
3. Type: %APPDATA%\my-app
4. Press Enter
5. Delete the "inventory.db" file
6. Restart the application


After following these steps, the error will be gone and you can add products
with only the Product Name field - all other fields will be optional!
